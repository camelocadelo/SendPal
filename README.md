# SendPal
# Overview
**A simple web application clone of PayPal to send and request transactions.**

The main functionality of the web application is to be able to pay any given amount of money to any user with an account, friend users, and view recent recent activity.  

SendPal uses Ruby on Rails/PostgreSQL on the backend with React/Redux on the frontend. This web application was fully designed and developed within a two-week time frame.
